/**
 * INSTRUCTIONS.
 * 
 * The following exercises are, perhaps, more mathematically inclined than previous
 * problem sets. While they might be challenging, they are certainly doable.
 * 
 * You can (and should!) solve each of them using only the operators, conditional control
 * structures, and iterative control strokers we've covered. You are not permitted to use
 * recursive code in your solutions.
 * 
 * Please be mindful of the expected outputs, as your code will be tested against that
 * directly. If you're unsure, please ask for clarification.
 * 
 * This problem set is worth 25 points and is due no later than 11:59pm on October 28, 2018.
